The need for legal literacy among children is increasingly evident in today's complex society. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to engage young minds effectively, hindering their understanding of crucial legal concepts necessary for navigating modern life. To address this challenge, educational technology has embraced gamification as a promising approach to enhance engagement and accessibility in learning. "Minilaw," an innovative gamified educational application, aims to fill this gap by providing a playful yet informative platform for introducing foundational legal principles to children. However, the effectiveness of "Minilaw" in cultivating legal literacy and promoting citizenship education in young learners remains largely unexplored. This study seeks to investigate the impact of "Minilaw" on enhancing children's comprehension of legal concepts, empowering them to navigate legal matters confidently and responsibly in today's evolving world.
